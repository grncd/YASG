If I were you, I would fight for myself
No one even knows, there's no, there's (ay)
And maybe it's not what it seems like
I thought you told me in spite of everything
And it's fucked up, waiting on you
I don't wanna go (ay)
And there's many things I wanna tell you
That you'll never know
And it's fucked up, waiting on you
Was it all for show? (ay) Yeah
And if it was, tell me was it all just something (ay)
I can't stand my future, I
And though I can't beckon on anyone to (ay)
All this going wrong, all this time
How can I make it make sense to you? I (ay)
I want a part of your loving too
Yeah, we're just levitating
Adore the company (ay)
Therе's nobody around
So don't go leave me
If I wеre you, I would fight for myself
No one even knows, there's no, there's
And maybe it's not what it seems like
I thought you told me in spite of everything
