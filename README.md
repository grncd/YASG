</p>

---

> [!WARNING]
> **YASG is currently in its early beta stage.** As such, you may encounter **various bugs or unexpected behavior** while playing.
If you discover any issues, please report them by creating an issue on the project’s GitHub page.

YASG (Yet Another Singing Game) **is a karaoke game** just like others, but **without the hassle of grabbing songs or lyrics yourself.** A simple search is all you need to play any song available on digital streaming platforms (DSPs).

# 🔽 [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://github.com/grncd/YASG/releases/download/v0.0.1a/Build.zip) (CURRENTLY WINDOWS-ONLY)
## ⚠️ Disclaimer

YASG relies on several open-source projects to function. These tools are not included with the game, but are installed on the created Python VENV automatically by the game's setup.
Special thanks to the developers of the following projects:

* **[syrics](https://github.com/akashrchandran/syrics)** – Main source for synced lyrics.
* **[spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader)** – Handles song downloading.
* **[demucs](https://github.com/adefossez/demucs)** and **[vocalremover.org](https://vocalremover.org/)** – Used for vocal/instrumental separation.
* **[LRCLib](https://lrclib.net/)** – Service that handles fallback and custom lyric database.
