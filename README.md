## 🧭 Overview

**YASG (Yet Another Singing Game)** is a karaoke game designed to make singing simple and fun.  
Unlike most karaoke games that restrict you to a set of playable songs / require manual work, **you don’t need to download songs or lyrics manually.** A quick search lets you play any track available on major digital streaming platforms (DSPs).

YASG analyzes your **voice pitch in real time**, compares it to the original singer’s, and **awards points based on accuracy.**
At the moment, YASG supports up to 4 players **locally**. Online mode is still being worked on.

These tools are not included with the game but are automatically installed within the game’s Python environment.

**Special thanks to the developers of the following projects:**

* [**syrics**](https://github.com/akashrchandran/syrics) – Main source for synced lyrics.  
* [**spotDL**](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader) – Handles song downloading.  
* [**demucs**](https://github.com/adefossez/demucs) and [**vocalremover.org**](https://vocalremover.org/) – Used for vocal/instrumental separation.  
* [**LRCLib**](https://lrclib.net/) – Provides fallback and custom lyric database support.
