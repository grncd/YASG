## 🧭 Overview

**YASG (Yet Another Singing Game)** is a karaoke game designed to make singing simple and fun.  
Unlike most karaoke games that restrict you to a set of playable songs / require manual work, **you don’t need to download songs or lyrics manually.** A quick search lets you play any track available on major digital streaming platforms (DSPs).

YASG analyzes your **voice pitch in real time**, compares it to the original singer’s, and **awards points based on accuracy.**
At the moment, YASG supports up to 4 players **locally**. Online mode is still being worked on.
